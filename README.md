## Problem Statement:
The problem that we are trying to solve is to predict the likelihood of a crime occurring in a given location and time in Seattle, using data on past crimes in the city. The data for this project will come from the Seattle Police Department website, and will include information on the location, time, and type of crimes that have occurred in the city. The data may also include other relevant information, such as the demographics of the area where the crime took place.
The stakeholders in this problem include the Seattle Police Department, city officials, and residents of Seattle. Accurate predictions of crime likelihood can help the police department allocate its resources more effectively, and can help city officials and residents make informed decisions about their safety.
